Firstly, <i>pagination</i> works everywhere, that is, a huge set of data that we store is divided into separate pages, and everything is for your convenience. The code of the corresponding js functions is partially taken from <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/\" style=\"color: #000000;\">StackOwerflow</a>. From here, we also have a few css files (they determine the appearance of pages).<br>Secondly, a lot of our beautiful pieces are borrowed from <a href=\"https://codepen.io/trending\"style=\" color: #000000; \">CodePen</a>, for example, all pages with errors (see our post \"Check out our error handlers!\"). Thanks to the frontend developers from there! Our team is sincerely grateful to them: we would never agree to do what they do.<br>All the best, our dear Akkadians!
